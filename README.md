# ðŸš¨ Hate Speech Detection using Machine Learning
ðŸš€ Overview
This project detects hate speech in text data, classifying messages as hate speech, offensive, or neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) models. It is trained on labeled datasets and can analyze social media posts, comments, or messages for toxic content.

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… Classifies text as hate speech, offensive, or neutral
âœ… Preprocessing pipeline: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming
âœ… Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
âœ… Deep learning support with LSTMs or Transformers (optional)
âœ… Real-time predictions with Flask API (optional)
âœ… Data visualization: Word clouds, confusion matrices

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
NLTK, SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (for feature extraction)
Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud (for visualization)
Flask/FastAPI (for API deployment)
